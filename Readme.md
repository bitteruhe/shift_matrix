# Matrix

This is a library for easier control of LED matrices. Using shift registers, only three pins of an Arduino are required to display all possible patterns and animations. This library only supports 8 by 8 matrices at the moment.

The pinout of the selfmade matrix is the following:

| ° | ° | ° | ° | ° |  
| - | - | - | - | - |  
| ° | ° | ° | ° | ° |  
| 5V | GND | SHIFT CLOCK | LATCH CLOCK | DATA INPUT |
